## Native Android App for Managing the Tasks

> This isn't the final version yet, more functions and design will be added.

Developed just for myself, posting it just to show off my shitty skills. Try it out if you want

Feel free to give comments through [my website](https://icefairycirno.github.io/My-Website/), and don't complain about the UI design. I am not a UI/UX designer.

Functions are 75% Vibe-Coded, Layouts are 0% Vibe-Coded.

0 cybersecurity, I don't think someone will be interested in my daily tasks.
